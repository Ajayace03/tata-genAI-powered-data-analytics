# Task 4: Implementing an AI-Driven Collections Strategy

## 📌 Project Context

This repository contains the work completed for **Task 4** of the AI-powered credit risk analytics project with **Geldium**, as part of the **Tata Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program** hosted on [Forage](https://www.theforage.com/simulations/tata/data-analytics-t3zr?reloaded=true).

Building on earlier tasks, this phase focused on designing a scalable and ethical AI system to automate collections decisions — transforming predictive insights into real-time, adaptive actions that reduce delinquency while upholding fairness and compliance.

## 🎯 Objective

To create a high-level, stakeholder-ready PowerPoint presentation that outlines an **autonomous AI collections system**, capable of:

- Identifying and engaging high-risk customers using predictive scores
- Personalizing outreach based on behavior and risk
- Embedding agentic AI to adapt and improve over time
- Maintaining regulatory alignment and ethical governance

---

## 🧩 System Components (Summarized in Slides)

### Slide 1–2: How the System Works
- Input: Customer risk signals from demographic, behavioral, and financial data
- Decision Engine: Combines AI risk scores + business rules
- Action Layer: Sends reminders, offers support plans, or escalates cases
- Learning Loop: Tracks outcomes and updates strategy continuously

### Slide 3: Role of Agentic AI
- Autonomous actions: Outreach timing, message type, risk classification
- Human-in-the-loop: Review hardship cases, handle disputes, audit fairness

### Slide 4: Responsible AI Guardrails
- Bias audits and fairness checks
- Explainable models (e.g., logistic regression with SHAP)
- GDPR/ECOA/FCA compliance alignment
- Oversight for all high-impact decisions

### Slide 5: Expected Business Impact
- 📊 Business KPIs: Lower delinquency (12–15%), reduced manual load (25%), increased collections efficiency
- 🤝 Customer Outcomes: Faster support, fairer treatment, higher satisfaction
