## üìå Overview

In this task, I translated AI-driven predictive insights into a clear, actionable business report for Geldium‚Äôs Head of Collections. The goal was to help the Collections team understand which customer segments are at highest risk of delinquency and recommend a data-backed intervention strategy aligned with business goals.

The report is structured around:
1. A summary of model-driven insights
2. A SMART recommendation
3. Ethical and responsible AI considerations

## üîç Summary of Predictive Insights

The logistic regression model identified key customer segments with elevated delinquency risk:

- **High-risk segment:** Customers under 30 with 2+ recent missed payments and credit utilization >60%
- **Top predictors:** Credit utilization, missed payments, and high debt-to-income (DTI) ratio
- **Key insight:** This group is 3.4x more likely to default, signaling urgent need for targeted intervention.

A summary table outlines the segment, contributing variables, and potential business action.

## ‚úÖ SMART Recommendation

**Pilot a 6-week digital outreach campaign** targeting the high-risk Gen Z segment with educational content, flexible repayment options, and early engagement tools.

- **Specific:** Focused on young customers with high risk scores
- **Measurable:** Goal to reduce 30+ day delinquency by 12%
- **Actionable:** Uses existing SMS, email, and app channels
- **Relevant:** Directly addresses high-risk segment identified by model
- **Time-bound:** 6-week campaign with weekly tracking

**Rationale:**  
This approach is scalable, low-cost, and customer-friendly ‚Äî aligning with Geldium‚Äôs mission to reduce risk while maintaining customer trust.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Ethical and Responsible AI Use

The report includes a dedicated ethics section addressing:

- **Fairness risks:** Potential bias against age or income groups is mitigated through fairness audits and careful feature selection.
- **Explainability:** Logistic regression offers clear reasoning behind each prediction, making it easy to communicate with stakeholders.
- **Responsible decision-making:** The recommendation supports financial wellness, not punitive action.
- **Ethical principles:** Transparency, accountability, and customer privacy were upheld throughout the analysis.
